# Inheritance Examples in Python

This repository contains Python code demonstrating various types of inheritance in object-oriented programming.

## Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from another class.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one base class.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from a base class, and then another class inherits from this derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

## Usage

Each Python file in this repository demonstrates one type of inheritance with accompanying explanations.

- `single_inheritance.py`: Demonstrates single inheritance.
- `multiple_inheritance.py`: Demonstrates multiple inheritance.
- `multilevel_inheritance.py`: Demonstrates multilevel inheritance.
- `hierarchical_inheritance.py`: Demonstrates hierarchical inheritance.
- `hybrid_inheritance.py`: Demonstrates hybrid inheritance.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how each type of inheritance works in Python.

## How to Run

You can run each Python file individually to see the inheritance examples in action. Simply execute the files using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python single_inheritance.py
python multiple_inheritance.py
# and so on...
